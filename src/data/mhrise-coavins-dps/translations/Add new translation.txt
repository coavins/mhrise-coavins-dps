Instructions for adding a new translation

1. Create a new json file in the translations directory:
		(for example)
	data/mhrise-coavins-dps/translations/fr-CA.json

2. Copy whatever strings you want to translate from the default en-US.json file
You don't have to translate everything; any keys that you skip will be displayed
in English.

3. Submit your translation file to the repository on Github.
You can submit it as a pull request, or create an issue and attach your file.

You can also send the file to me on Nexus Mods if you don't have a Github account.
